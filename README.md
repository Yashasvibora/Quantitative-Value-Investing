# Quantitative Value Investing using Python
Value Investing is an investment strategy wherein the investor looks for stocks with an undervalued price or that appear to be trading below their intrinsic value. Value investors look at different metrics and data of the company as it involves complex calculation. Value Investing believes in the fact that while the price of a stock is obvious and volatile, the intrinsic value of a stock is not apparent but relatively stable.
Quantitative Investing is another type of investing wherein the investor looks through historical market data that is quantitative in nature and uses powerful computers and advanced mathematical models to pick the right stock/company for investment.
In order to ease this process of complex evaluation and calculations, Quantitative Value Investing is introduced, which automates the data analysis and calculation aspects of Value Investing.
